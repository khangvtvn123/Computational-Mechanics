# Computational Mechanics
[in progress]

This is all the projects and homeworks I did for Computational Mechanics class using Python.

To run the files, you would need to download these library:

1. NumPy: https://numpy.org/install/
2. Matplotlib: https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/installing/index.html
3. SciPy: https://scipy.org/install/
4. scikit-learn: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html#install-official-release
